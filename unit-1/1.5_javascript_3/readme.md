# Javascript Day 3

## Lecture Notes

The `replit-outline.js` file contains the notes/examples I type out with the class in repl.it (or similar code editor).

At the end of the lecture, the repl.it will become notes and a reference point for the students, so I make sure to pace the lecture in a way that they can keep up and type along.

- _Note:_ although it is not included in the `replit-outline.js` file, I review the callback pattern they learned the day previously if the mentors haven't already covered the concept in their review.
