# Javascript Day 2

## Lecture Notes

The `replit-outline.js` file contains the notes/examples I type out with the class in repl.it (or similar code editor).

- When it comes to Array methods, demonstrate each method we will be talking about, and then ask the questions included -

  1.  What does the method return?
  2.  What did it do to the original array?
  3.  What are the required arguments?
  4.  What are the optional arguments?

- Everything else is pretty self-explanitory from the `replit-outline.js` file.

At the end of the lecture, the repl.it will become notes and a reference point for the students, so I make sure to pace the lecture in a way that they can keep up and type along.
