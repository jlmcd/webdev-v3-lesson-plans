# 3.1 Closures and Classes

## Resources
Slides are included in this folder (closures.key). They cover only closures.

The `replit-outline.js` file contains the notes/examples I type out with the class in repl.it.

At the end of the lecture, the repl.it will become notes and a reference point for the students, so I make sure to pace the lecture in a way that they can keep up and type along.
